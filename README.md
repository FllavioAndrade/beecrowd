# Beecrowd
Solving Beecrowd problems using Python and GoLang.
<p>

### How do these problems work?
In general, each problem has a statement, well-defined input, and output.
<br>
- The statement provides context and presents the problem to be solved.
- The input outlines the general format of the input and its limits.
- The output specifies how the answer should be presented.
- In Beecrowd, the correction is automatic, performed by software - that runs your program with certain values and compares its output with the expected outputâ€”comparison is character by character; line by line.
- You can submit solutions to the problems in various languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, GoLang and many others."
